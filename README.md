# Reinforcement Learning
![RL image](intro.jpg)
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

Personally, for me, what excites me about RL is its application in automation and more varied robotic functions

## Project Sources
Programming assignments from University of Alberta's Reinforcement Learning Specialization <br>
Capstone Project (Lunar Lander) from University of Alberta's Reinforcement Learning Specialization<br>
[Gym from OpenAI](https://gym.openai.com/) 
Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It supports teaching agents everything from walking to playing games like Pong or Pinball.<br>

## Learning:
### Foundations
Markov's Reward Process, Markov's Decision Process and Bellman's Equations and Bellman's optimal equations<br>
Modelling k-Armed Bandits<br>
Value functions (State Value Function and Action Value Function)<br>
Exploration vs. Exploitation vs. e-Greedy functions <br>

### Solving Bellman's and Bellman's optimization functions:
With Model and Model-free<br>
Prediction vs. Control - Policy Iteration / Value Iteration - TD vs. SARSA, e-SARSA and Q-learning<br>
On-policy vs off-policy model<br>

### Solving large state / continuous states
Functional approximation<br>
Discretization<br>
Coarse and Tile coding<br>
DQN<br>
