# Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

Personally, for me, what excites me about RL is its application in automation and more varied robotic functions

Most of the exercises here have been performed through University of Alberta's Reinforcement Learning Specialization or [AI Gym from OpenAI](https://gym.openai.com/) <br>
Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It supports teaching agents everything from walking to playing games like Pong or Pinball.
