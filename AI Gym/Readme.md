# OpenAI gym
![RL agents](RL_samples.gif)
Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It supports teaching agents everything from walking to playing games like Pong or Pinball.

It makes no assumptions about the structure of your agent, and is compatible with any numerical computation library, such as TensorFlow or Theano.

The [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) library is a collection of test problems — environments — that you can use to work out your reinforcement learning algorithms. These environments have a shared interface, allowing you to write general algorithms.

Available Environments
Gym comes with a diverse suite of environments that range from easy to difficult and involve many different kinds of data. View the full list of environments to get the birds-eye view.

Classic control and toy text: complete small-scale tasks, mostly from the RL literature. They’re here to get you started.
Algorithmic: perform computations such as adding multi-digit numbers and reversing sequences. One might object that these tasks are easy for a computer. The challenge is to learn these algorithms purely from examples. These tasks have the nice property that it’s easy to vary the difficulty by varying the sequence length.
Atari: play classic Atari games. We’ve integrated the Arcade Learning Environment (which has had a big impact on reinforcement learning research) in an easy-to-install form.
2D and 3D robots: control a robot in simulation. These tasks use the MuJoCo physics engine, which was designed for fast and accurate robot simulation. Included are some environments from a recent benchmark by UC Berkeley researchers (who incidentally will be joining us this summer). MuJoCo is proprietary software, but offers free trial licenses.

**Note:** Most of the agents built by me on Gym.AI environments have been built on templates from Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Github (https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning)
